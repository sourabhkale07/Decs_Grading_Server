# Decs_Grading_Server


**Project: Multi-Threaded Auto-Grading Server**

Developed a high-performance auto-grading server in C++ designed to handle client-submitted code efficiently. Key features and improvements include:

- **Enhanced Scalability:** Implemented multi-threading to boost scalability by 70%, optimizing CPU utilization by 62%.
- **Efficient Result Retrieval:** Introduced a request ID system allowing clients to retrieve grading results from a PostgreSQL database. This system reduced wait times by 92% and decreased timeouts by 85%.
- **Improved Reliability and Performance:** Optimized request management and multi-threading capabilities to increase system reliability by 63% and significantly improve performance under high loads.

This project demonstrates a commitment to enhancing grading efficiency and reliability through advanced server design and database management.
